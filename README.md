## What is Funfit? 
Funfit is a mobile application that helps users stick with their workout routines, thus promoting a healhty lifestyle. 

## Problem motivation 
In the hussle and bussle of modern life, it is difficult to strike a balance between maintaining a healthy lifestyle and working. We, as university students, also struggle to do this even though both of us are keen on working out. Sometimes it is because we forget or other times we just lose the motivation. Therefore, we came up with the idea of an app that promotes a healthy lifestyle, helping building a supportive and inspiring community.
