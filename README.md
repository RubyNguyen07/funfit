## What is Funfit? 
Funfit is a mobile application that helps users stick with their workout routines, thus promoting a healhty lifestyle. 

## Problem motivation 
In the hussle and bussle of modern life, it is difficult to strike a balance between maintaining a healthy lifestyle and working. We, as university students, also struggle to do this even though both of us are keen on working out. Sometimes it is because we forget or other times we just lose the motivation. Therefore, we came up with the idea of an app that promotes a healthy lifestyle, helping building a supportive and inspiring community. 

## Core user stories 
- As a user, 
  + I can upload my profile picture and add my details (Home page). 
  + I can find suitable workout routines from fitness experts (Routine feature). 
  + I can save all my favourite workout routines in one place (Routine feature). 
  + I can plan routines ahead and keep track of my progress (Calendar feature). 
  + I can be reminded of my workout schedules (Notification feauture). 
  + I can gain points after completing each routine (Scoring system). 
  + I can chat with other like-minded users and view stories of other inspiring users (Stories and Chat features).
